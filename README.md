# NormandaleProgrammingClubWebApp
Hello Programming Club members!  This git repo is for the Programming Club Web App.  The webapp is being designed with React.js, a JavaScript Library.

How to use:
 - There are two main ways to get this up and running.  If you plan on using your own computer, you can set up your own local environment by installing node.js.  The latest revision can be found here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
 
 - Once downloaded, follow the installation instructions using a command prompt here: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html#creating-a-new-application
 
 - This might take a few minutes, but once you are done, remove everything from your src folder and create an index.css and index.js files
